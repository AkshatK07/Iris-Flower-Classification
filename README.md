Iris Species Classification Project:

Overview:
This project focuses on training a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their measurements.
The dataset used for this project is the well-known Iris dataset, which includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, 
and petal width for three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

1. Introduction
  The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of training a machine learning model for classification.
  The chosen algorithm for this task is the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model is trained on the Iris dataset,
  and its performance is evaluated on a test set.

2. Setup:
  Prerequisites.
    a. Python (version 3.x recommended)
   
    b. Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive exploration)
   
  Installation.
    a. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification-project.git
      cd iris-classification-project
   
    b. Install the required dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt
  
3. Usage:
    a. Open the Jupyter Notebook iris_classification.ipynb:
       jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
      
    b. Execute each cell in the notebook to load the Iris dataset, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.
    
    c. Explore the results and tweak the code as needed.

4. Files:
    a. iris_classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
  
5. Dependencies:
    a. scikit-learn
   
    b. pandas
 
6. Acknowledgments:
    a. The Iris dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   
    b. Inspiration and guidance from various online tutorials and resources.
